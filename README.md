- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashik Saeed Supto

- 💻 I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer

- 🐡 I have been leading [Cloudly’s](https://cloudly.io/) nimble, but mighty development team and led the development of a few complex Enterprise solutions that work across iOS, Android, and Web platforms over the past 7+ years. I pioneered the architecture, design, and development of a “mobile-first approach” at Cloudly while developing a College Alumni digital platform and cleverly designed a React Native application that works seamlessly across all different platforms. It is currently used by tens of thousands of users.

- 🌿 I lead mobile, and backend teams, mentoring these development teams across the entire development cycle - from user experience and design patterns to database schema and API designs. I drive the teams with fast iteration and smooth integration between different software / UI components and contents. I excel in design, code, debugging, and performance tuning of complex component interactions on- and off-platform in order to ensure high quality. well-functioning software that always delivers optimal user experience.

- 🔥 I feel comfortable working with Kotlin, Java & TypeScript
