- 💻 I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer and a Top Rated Plus Freelancer on UpWork.

- 🐡 Over the past 6+ years, I have led [Cloudly’s](https://cloudly.io/) nimble but mighty development team and delivered complex Enterprise solutions that work seamlessly across iOS, Android, and Web platforms. I pioneered a "mobile-first approach" at Cloudly, developing a College Alumni digital platform and a React Native application that is currently used by tens of thousands of users.
